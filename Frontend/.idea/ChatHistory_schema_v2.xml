The query translates to: \&quot;My teammate made changes and pushed in the notification branch, I\u0027m working in that branch too, what command should I write in the terminal to get those changes?\&quot;\n\nEssentially, the user wants to pull the latest changes from the notification branch that their teammate pushed. Since they\u0027re working in the same branch, they need to use git pull to fetch and merge the remote changes.\n\nThe standard command for this would be: `git pull origin notification`\n\nWhere:\n- `git pull` is the command to fetch and merge changes\n- `origin` is the default name for the remote repository\n- `notification` is the branch name mentioned by the user\n\nIf they are already on the notification branch, they could simply use `git pull` without specifying the branch.&quot;,&quot;signature&quot;:&quot;EqoBCkgIAxABGAIiQDT3yBOGt1TgWJZ/m64N57bZ9bFCbOUwfkUjSF+efBq+ka3spvGvn9svOp17nZ9dLPUBzAQXDo5KW7z+xZLZ94cSDLDE71TUra5YKSqPeBoMnJeicctYrIcVrt8OIjD5mzKmS14SyV8JBP60VcXTEQFkrFhFN2lN+IxhSbCVEVxi0d96BlQUuctMrEYGKxYqECzhRxR/V0eYjiYWgruBi4Y\u003d&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;git pull origin notification&quot;}]}]}" />
